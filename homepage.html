    India, officially the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[22] is a country in South Asia. It is the
    seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023;[23][24] and from the time of its
    independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.[25][26][27] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the
    Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the
    west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar[k] to the east. In the Indian Ocean,
    India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with
    Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.

    Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[28][29][30] Their long
    occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second
    only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[31] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of
    the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium
    BCE.[32] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the
    northwest.[33][34] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was
    resolutely vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[35] The Dravidian languages of India were
    supplanted in the northern and western regions.[36] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged
    within Hinduism,[37] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders

    The United States of America (USA or U.S.A.), commonly known as the United States (US or U.S.) or America, is a 
     country primarily located in North America, between Canada and Mexico. It is a federation of 50 states, a federal 
     capital district (Washington, D.C.), and 326 Indian reservations. Outside the union of states, it asserts
     sovereignty over five major unincorporated island territories and various uninhabited islands.[j] The country 
     has the world's third-largest land area,[d] largest maritime exclusive economic zone, and the third-largest 
      population, exceeding 334 million.[k]

   Paleo-Indians migrated across the Bering land bridge more than 12,000 years ago. British colonization led to
   the first settlement of the Thirteen Colonies in Virginia in 1607. Clashes with the British Crown over taxation and 
   political representation sparked the American Revolution, with the Second Continental Congress formally declaring 
    independence on July 4, 1776. Following its victory in the Revolutionary War (1775–1783), the country continued to
    expand across North America. As more states were admitted, sectional division over slavery led to the secession of 
   the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the 1861–1865 American 
    Civil War. With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. By 1900, the United States
   had become the world's largest economy and established itself as a great power. After Japan's attack on Pearl 
   Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. The aftermath of the war left the U.S. and the Soviet 
    Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle 
    for ideological dominance and international influence. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end.
